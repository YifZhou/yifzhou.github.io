**Dr. Arthur Adams** specializes in atmospheric retrieval and mapping techniques. He analyzes JWST data to investigate atmospheric dynamics and three-dimensional structures in exoplanets.

**Dr. Dorian Demars** studies accretion processes during giant planet formation. Through multi-epoch imaging and spectroscopy, Dr. Demars tests theoretical models of how young planets accumulate mass.

**Daphne Broski-Laing** is a graduate student at UVA. She uses JWST spectroscopic time series observations to study the atmospheres and evolution of irradiated brown dwarfs.

**Danya Alboslani** is a graduate student at UVA. She investigates dynamical processes in brown dwarf and free-floating planetary-mass object atmospheres through JWST observations and atmospheric modeling.

**Maddie Chapleski** is an undergraduate student at UVA. She observes and models variable infrared emission from brown dwarfs. Her work on HST time-resolved spectroscopic observations of variable brown dwarfs earned her an AAS Chambliss award for poster presentation.

**Ben Chang** is an undergraduate student at UVA. He uses coronagraphic imaging observations to construct the spectral energy distribution of a brown dwarf companion. His investigation validates atmospheric and evolutionary models used for interpreting exoplanet observations.


<img src="/images/Li.png" width=100 style='float:left;margin:5px 30px'>

**Yihan Li** is an undergraduate student at Peking University and a visiting student at UVA. She re-purposes MIRI time series imaging data for high-contrast imaging searches of exoplanets. Her work demonstrates the capability of JWST TSO data for direct imaging applications.

## Former group members

- **Sawyer Tabor**, undergraduate research assistant at UVA. His senior thesis focuses on H-alpha high-contrast imaging of planet-forming disks.
- **Cassidy Walker**, undergraduate research assistant at UVA. She conducts initial exploration of repurposing MIRI TSO data through analysis of TRAPPIST-1 observations.
