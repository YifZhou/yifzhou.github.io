<img src="/images/Me_working.jpeg" width=300 style='float:right;margin:5px 30px'>  I am an assistant professor at the Department of Astronomy at the University of Virginia. **I'm eagerly looking for students and postdocs to join my team.** <br/><br/>

My research focuses on unraveling the formation and atmospheric properties of planets. As an observational astronomer, I use the most advanced space and grand-based telescopes to search for protoplanets, characterize planetary atmosphere, and map the evolutionary pathways of planetary systems. I am passionate about developing innovative observational programs that further our exploration of exoplanets. I am the principal investigator of observation programs with the most powerful telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope, and Keck Telescope observation programs. Please check out the [research page](/research/) for more details about these projects! <br/><br/>

**If you're fascinated by exoplanets, planet formation, and high-contrast imaging observations, let's work together!** Please reach out to me, and let's embark on this cosmic adventure as a team!
