My name is Yifan Zhou. I am a Harlan J. Smith McDoanld Observatory postdoctoral fellow at [UT Austin](https://astronomy.utexas.edu "Department of Astronomy, UT Austin"). I got my Ph.D. in Astronomy and Astrophysics from [Steward Observatory/Unversity of Arizona](https://www.as.arizona.edu "Steward Observatory, Department of Astronomy/University of Arizona") in 2019, working with [Prof. Daniel Apai](https://distantearths.com).

I am interested in the formation and atmospheric characterizations of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. For my thesis study, I pioneered in using Hubble Space Telescope to monitor the photometric and spectroscopic variabilies of brown dwarf and planetary mass companions. These observations delivered rich information about the patchy cloud coverages, atmospheric circulations, and angular momentum of substellar objects. 
I also devloped new techniques for high-precision Hubble Space Telescope time-series observations and applied them to spectroscopic observations of transiting exoplanets. At UT and McDonald Observatory, I am collaborating with [Prof. Brendan Bowler](http://www.as.utexas.edu/~bpbowler/), Prof. Caroline Morley, and Prof. Adam Kraus on multiple projects related to the atmospheres and formation of exoplanets. Please checkout the [research page](/research/) for more details about these projects!
