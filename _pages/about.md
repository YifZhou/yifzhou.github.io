My name is Yifan Zhou. I am a Harlan J. Smith McDoanld Observatory postdoctoral fellow at UT Austin. I got my Ph.D. in Astronomy and Astrophysics from Steward Observatory/University of Arizona in 2019, working with Prof. Daniel Apai.

I am interested in the formation and atmospheric characterizations of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. For my thesis study, I pioneered in using Hubble Space Telescope to monitor the photometric and spectroscopic variabilies of brown dwarf and planetary mass companions. These observations delivered rich information about the patchy cloud coverages, atmospheric circulations, and angular momentum of substellar objects. 
I also devloped new techniques for high-precision Hubble Space Telescope time-series observations and applied them to spectroscopic observations of transiting exoplanets. At UT and McDonald Observatory, I am collaborating with Prof. Brendan Bowler, Caroline Morley, and Adam Kraus on multiple projects related to the atmospheres and formation of exoplanets. Please checkout the research page for more details about these projects!
