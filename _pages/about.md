 <img src="/images/HSTandMe_lowQ.jpg" width=300 style='float:right;margin:5px 30px'> My name is Yifan Zhou. I am a Harlan J. Smith McDonald Observatory postdoctoral fellow at [UT Austin](https://astronomy.utexas.edu "Department of Astronomy, UT Austin"). I got my Ph.D. in Astronomy and Astrophysics from [Steward Observatory/Unversity of Arizona](https://www.as.arizona.edu "Steward Observatory, Department of Astronomy/University of Arizona") in 2019, working with [Prof. Daniel Apai](https://distantearths.com).<br/><br/>

I am interested in the formation and atmospheric properties of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. For my Ph.D. thesis, I studied the photometric and spectroscopic variability of brown dwarf and planetary-mass companions using Hubble Space Telescope observations. My research advanced our understanding of the patchy cloud coverages, atmospheric circulations, and angular momentum of substellar objects. I also developed new techniques for high-precision Hubble Space Telescope time-series observations and applied them to spectroscopic observations of transiting exoplanets. At UT Austin and McDonald Observatory, I am collaborating with [Prof. Brendan Bowler](http://www.as.utexas.edu/~bpbowler/), Prof. Caroline Morley, and Prof. Adam Kraus on multiple projects related to planet formation and characterizations. Please check out the [research page](/research/) for more details about these projects!
