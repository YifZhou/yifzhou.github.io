So far (Aug 2020), more than 75% (3191/4201) of exoplanets are discovered by transit. Transmission spectroscopy is the most popular method for studying the atmospheres of exoplanets. I contributed to a few studies with my expertise in high-precison Hubble Space Telescope (HST) time-series observations.

I (together with Prof. Daniel Apai and Dr. Ben Rackham) mentored an undergraduate student, Zhanbo Zhang, to re-analyze HST/WFC3 observations of TRAPPIST-1 planets. In [this study](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....156..178Z/abstract) We corrected light curve systematics with the model [RECTE](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....153..243Z/abstract), for which I led the devlopment. From the combined spectrum of six of the seven TRAPPIST-1 planets, we demonstrated that the un-occulated stellar spots/faculae could introduce contaminating spectroscopic features. Therefore, understanding the stellar surface structures is crucial for accurately interpreting transmission spectra.<br/>

I am involved a few other transmission spectroscopy studies, including [the first discovery of escaping atmospheres from an exoplanets](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018Natur.557...68S/abstract).<br/>

I am a co-investigator of an HST program studying close brown dwarf companions of white dwarfs. These brown dwarfs receive powerful radiations from the white dwarfs and behave similarly to hot Jupiters. However, the brown dwarf thermal radiation signals are much stronger than typical hot Jupiters. Therefore, these brown dwarf-white dwarf pairs are excellent test cases for hot Jupiter atmospheric theories. We are looking forward to these exciting observations.
